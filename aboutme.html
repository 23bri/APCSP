    <p class="p">Hi my name is Bree and I am in High School. I love volleyball and basketball and competively play for clubs. My summers look like traveling on the road and camping. I like ice cream, honeslty almost any flavor, and pies! Baking is something I enjoy and love to do. I am focusing on anything STEM and want to study that in college.
